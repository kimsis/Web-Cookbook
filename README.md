# PartiRecept Ionic + React 

### Link to application http://partirecept.com/

The goal of PartiRecept is to create a cookbook which connects the unique neighbourhood of Oud-Woensel and its culinary culture with the people living of the area. The platform is a place where users can share delicious recipes connected to the neighbourhood and explore its flavours.

## Motivation

Technology has been often used for projects with social benefits, and this one was no exception. The big neighbourhood of Woensel is growing not only physically, but culturally. Seinpost's goal is to to create a project, which unites all the different cultures of Woensel through their cuisine and ultimately bring a better image to the region

To achieve this goal we developed a cookbook application where:

- Users can view recipes from different regions and cultures, as well as how to make them, and where the dish is served on the map. Each person will be able to participate, by adding his recipe to the mix. The users will be able to save their favourites and rate recipes via the application.
- Administrators can oveview the content of the system (and future developers) to approve recipes of users, create, modify and delete data.

## Installation
- Clone the repo
- Intall the npm modules with `npm install`
- Run the application with `ionic serve`

For reference go to https://ionicframework.com/docs

Ionic allows to build the app for iOS and Android and on top of that supports Progressive Web Applications

## Deployment

- run `ionic build` at the project root folder
- upload the build folder to a hosting service
